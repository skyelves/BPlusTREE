# BPlusTREE
An implementation of BPlusTree in C++

All inner nodes in B+Tree have n pointers with (n-1) keys except the root node.

The nodes named bptnode are derived from Node in struct.h, where I illustrate some base structures.

Everyone can see the visualization of B+Tree on <https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BPlusTree.html>
